morning started with a ton of failed signon attempts to my VPN, it had to be a brute force password guessing program.

There was no way to limit the number of attempts on the VPN, so I came across a post about using the geo-ip filter.

I blocked all countries except Canada and the US and the attacks stopped immediately.
